# morse-blinker
ESP32 Programming Board LED pin blink sequense designed as a custom Morse code message.

This project shows how to program an ESP32 programming board to blink its LED in a custom Morse‑code sequence.
It’s a simple but expressive example of MicroPython running on ESP32 hardware, combining GPIO control, timing logic, and modular code structure.
